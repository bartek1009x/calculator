# calculator
There was a challenge in the Socii Cybernetici guild of the [Catholic Diocese of Discord](https://discord.gg/HZBqYuBFN7) to make a calculator app with a terrible UI. I had a few different ideas but in the end I've settled on this one, and in this repository you can see the result of my work.

Greatest calculator ever. Written in C++ and SDL3 with the help of AI because I've never done anything in SDL, I don't know how I would write code to evaluate an arithmetic expression and I don't even know C++ too well. I barely know what I was doing overall but I like what came out of this small project. No other calculator app has such good UX.
